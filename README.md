# Auto-connect to FortiGate VPN

This uses an OSS client for connecting to FortiGate that builds on top of the PPP protocol (uses `pppd` under the hood). It's fast.

## Install requirements

- A Node.js version
- https://github.com/adrienverge/openfortivpn (`brew install openfortivpn` on macOS, there are packages for Linux), or, alternatively, openconnect (`brew install openconnect`)
- `git clone https://github.com/dext/openfortivpn-webview && cd openfortivpn-webview/openfortivpn-webview-electron && npm install` (this should be built and distributed in a nicer way, as an electron app.)
- Add `openfortivpn` (or `openconnect`) to your sudoers file (it needs sudo to add routes, modify DNS, etc.) Save this in `/etc/sudoers.d/openfortivpn`:

  ```
  Cmnd_Alias  OPENFORTIVPN = /opt/homebrew/bin/openfortivpn

  ALL       ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD: OPENFORTIVPN
  ```
  
  Make sure to adjust the path if you're not on macOS and/or haven't installed openfortivpn via Homebrew.

- Add the following to `/etc/ppp/peers/dext` to customise the behaviour of pppd (to enforce quick connection downtime detection) â€“ it essentially overrides the params openfortivpn uses to connect to the VPN (I've taken them from the openfortivpn repo) and adds the following: `lcp-echo-interval 2` and `lcp-echo-failure 3` (see `man pppd` to understand how these two work). Paste the following:

  ```
  230400
  :169.254.2.1
  noipdefault
  ipcp-accept-local
  noaccomp
  noauth
  default-asyncmap
  nopcomp
  receive-all
  nodefaultroute
  nodetach
  lcp-max-configure 40
  mru 1354
  lcp-echo-interval 2
  lcp-echo-failure 3
  usepeerdns
  ```

  `usepeerdns` fixes the DNS resoltion on macOS, as suggested here: [make DNS resolution work on macOS](https://github.com/adrienverge/openfortivpn/issues/534).

## Run it

### Preferred: with `openfortivpn` (with auto-connect)

From within the cloned repo:

```
./connect-dext
```

### With `openconnect` (quick and dirty but auto-connects)

```
cd openfortivpn-webview/openfortivpn-webview-electron/ && while true; do npx electron index.js access.dext.pub --url-regex '/sslvpn/portal/index.html' | sudo openconnect access.dext.pub --protocol=fortinet --cookie-on-stdin --reconnect-timeout=5 --force-dpd=5; sleep 5; done
```

## Original readme of openfortivpn-webview

Application to perform the SAML single sing-on and easily retrieve the
`SVPNCOOKIE` needed by [`openfortivpn`](https://github.com/adrienverge/openfortivpn/).

The application will simply open the SAML page to let you sign in.
As soon as the `SVPNCOOKIE` is set, the application will print it to
stdout and exit.

The application comes in two flavors:
 - [openfortivpn-webview-qt](openfortivpn-webview-qt/)
 - [openfortivpn-webview-electron](openfortivpn-webview-electron/)

They should be equivalent, but `openfortivpn-webview-qt` may have
some issues with some SAML providers.

`openfortivpn-webview-electron` is readily available, see the
[instructions](https://github.com/gm-vm/openfortivpn-webview/tree/main/openfortivpn-webview-electron#install)
on how to install it.

## Usage

Obtain `SVPNCOOKIE` for host `vpn-gateway`:
```sh
openfortivpn-webview vpn-gateway
```

You can also specify an authentication realm (normally not required):
```sh
openfortivpn-webview vpn-gateway:1234 --realm=foo
```

By default the application builds the SAML URL using the given host,
port and realm. You can alternatively provide an already built URL:

```sh
openfortivpn-webview --url 'https://vpn-gateway:1234/remote/saml/start?realm=foo'
```

The application exits automatically as soon as it prints `SVPNCOOKIE` to
stdout. You can change this behavior passing `--keep-open`. The application
will in this case stay open and keep printing `SVPNCOOKIE` as its value
changes, thus generating a stream of text.

The application does not print `SVPNCOOKIE` until it finds a URL matching
the regular expression passed to `--url-regex`. If no regular expression
is specified, the application will look for URLs containing `/sslvpn/portal.html`.
Waiting for such URL allows to deal with concurrent VPN sessions when the
gateway is configured to allow a single active session.


The inner Chromium engine may print a lot of messages. You can disable them
to only see the messages of the application.

```sh
# If you use the Qt variant
QT_LOGGING_RULES="*=false;webview=true" QTWEBENGINE_CHROMIUM_FLAGS="--enable-logging --log-level=3" openfortivpn-webview vpn-gateway

# If you use the Electron variant
openfortivpn-webview --enable-logging --log-level=3 vpn-gateway
```

## Proxy servers

If you have to use an http proxy to access the vpn gateway or the SAML id
provider, you can pass the `--proxy-server` option to Chromium.

Note that when using the Electron variant, all command line options are
also passed along to Chromium.

```sh
# If you use the Qt variant
QTWEBENGINE_CHROMIUM_FLAGS="--proxy-server=proxy.example.com:8080" openfortivpn-webview vpn-gateway

# If you use the Electron variant
openfortivpn-webview vpn-gateway --proxy-server=proxy.example.com:8080
```

## Passing command line options when using `npm start`

If you use `npm start` to start the Electron variant, you need to separate
the command line options to the application from the command line options
to npm using `--`, like this:

```sh
npm start myvpnhost -- --proxy-server=proxy.example.com:8080
```
